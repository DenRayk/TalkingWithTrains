# TalkingWithTrains

## Project Overview

This project is a part of a student research initiative at DHBW Karlsruhe aimed at implementing a speech control system
for the DHBW Modellbahnanlage. The DHBW Modellbahnanlage is a model train system used for educational and recreational
purposes within the university. The objective of this research project is to enhance the user experience and
accessibility of the model train system by enabling it to be controlled through voice commands.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Users can control various aspects of the model train system by issuing voice commands, such as
  starting and stopping trains, changing track directions, controlling speed, and more.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The system provides real-time feedback to users, confirming the execution of commands and
  notifying them of any issues or errors.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The core of the system is implemented in Python, which is used to process voice commands, control the
  model train system, and provide feedback to users.
- **SpeechRecognition**: This library is used to recognize voice commands and convert them into text.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the
following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Usage

Run the main script to start the speech control system:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will begin listening for voice commands. Speak clearly and wait for the system's responses.
